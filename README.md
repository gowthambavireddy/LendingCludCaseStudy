## Loan Default Risk Analysis

**Outline a brief description of your project**

This project focuses on analyzing loan default data to identify key factors that drive the risk of default among borrowers. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and various statistical techniques, the project aims to help the company optimize its lending strategies, reduce credit losses, and improve risk assessment models. The analysis is driven by the company's objective to minimize financial loss from loan defaults by identifying high-risk applicants.

## General Information

**Project Background:**

The company is one of the largest online loan marketplaces, facilitating personal, business, and medical financing loans. The company's main challenge is dealing with loan defaults, which contribute to significant financial losses. By identifying the key factors leading to defaults, the company can optimize its risk management strategies.

**Business Problem:**

The primary business problem addressed is credit loss, where loans are defaulted on, causing financial damage to the lender. The company aims to identify risky applicants through data-driven analysis and reduce the incidence of defaults by refining its lending criteria.

**Dataset Information:**

The dataset used for this analysis contains loan information, including applicant details (e.g., income, employment history, credit score), loan characteristics (e.g., amount, interest rate, term), and loan status (e.g., "Fully Paid," "Charged-Off" for defaulted loans). This data enables the analysis of the relationship between loan features and default rates, providing insights into the factors contributing to loan defaults.

## Conclusions

**Conclusion 1:**

A significant proportion (83%) of loans are fully paid, indicating that the majority of borrowers successfully repay their loans. However, defaults (14.2%) are still a substantial issue that needs to be addressed to mitigate financial losses.

**Conclusion 2:**

Higher interest rates correlate with higher default rates. Borrowers with loans at interest rates above 20% have the highest chances of default, suggesting that high-interest rates attract riskier borrowers.

**Conclusion 3:**

Loan terms play a critical role in defaults, with longer loan terms (e.g., 60 months) exhibiting higher default rates compared to shorter terms (e.g., 36 months). This suggests that the risk of default increases as the loan duration lengthens.

**Conclusion 4:**

Employment length and income stability are strong predictors of loan defaults. Borrowers with shorter employment histories (less than a year) are more likely to default on loans. A borrower’s job stability plays a key role in assessing the risk.
